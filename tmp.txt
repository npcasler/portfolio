	    { 'name': 'tmp', 'src': 'High resolution data is pretty awesome, it provides us with more details about our world.
	  The new 3DEP initiative in the USGS is promising to have 1-meter coverage for the
	  contiguous 48 states within 5 years, which will be a huge leap from the current 10-30m 
	  products. 
	 
	  Unfortunately this increase in detail also brings an increase in noise and bias.
	  I feel that the noise issue in LiDAR data is reflective of a lot of the problems
	  that arise when data gets big. Small, somewhat unnoticed issues produce large changes in output.
	  When looking to process a dataset several Petabytes in size, it is important to
	  figure out a general workflow and identify the most difficult and/or time consuming pieces.' }
