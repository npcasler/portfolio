		  <h1>About</h1>
		  <p>I am a Geospatial programmer with a focus on workflow optimization
		  and computer vision. I am experienced as a full-stack developer and consultant, 
		  but my primary interests are in scalable database development and performance 
		  optimization for data pipelines. I have worked in a variety of domains with 
		  research, government and industry teams.</p>
		  <p>I am experienced in many areas of geospatial analysis, from urban development,
		  to resource assessment and terrain analytics. My current endeavors revolve around
		  parallel LiDAR processing, and unsupervised terrain classfication through the use 
		  of scale-space and hierarchical methods.</p>
		  <p>I am always looking for challenging computational and data-driven problems. If you
		  have any project needs or interest in my work please contact me at npcasler@gmail.com.
